# CRUD-App
A Fullstack program demonstrating CRUD functionality

# Goal
Using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node) build a restful API full-stack web application. Your application should cover CRUD operations â€“ the user should be able to create, read, update, and delete data. You are responsible for creating your own data schema. Using Node, you should design API endpoints and handler functions to process user requests and generate the appropriate responses. For the front-end you should create React components to make your code more functional and modular.

### MVP
- [x] Create an express server
- [x] Create at least 4 API endpoints where the user can perform CRUD operations.
- [x] Create a front-end display that can render the data from the backend using modern web design principles
- [ ] Search function to search data, display the data if it exist or show an appropriate error if the data does not exist
- [x] Basic account creation - allow users to signup and login
