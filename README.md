# CRUD-App
A Fullstack program demonstrating CRUD functionality

# Goal
Using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node) build a restful API full-stack web application. The application covers CRUD operations â€“ the user should be able to create, read, update, and delete data. Responsible for creating own data schema. Using Node, design API endpoints and handler functions to process user requests and generate the appropriate responses. For the front-end used React components to make your more functional and modular.
